## Abstract
The increasing complexity of Artificial Intelligence models poses challenges to interpretability, particularly in healthcare sector. This study investigates the impact of the deep learning models complexity and Explainable AI (XAI) efficacy, utilizing four ResNet architectures (ResNet-18, 34, 50, 101). Through methodical experimentation on 4,369 lung X-ray images of COVID-19-infected and healthy patients, the research evaluates models' classification performance and the relevance of corresponding XAI explanations with respect to the ground-truth disease masks. Results indicate that the increase in model complexity is associated with the decrease in classification accuracy and AUC-ROC scores (ResNet-18: 98.4\%, 0.997, ResNet-101: 95.9\%, 0.988). Notably, in eleven out of twelve statistical tests performed, no statistically significant differences occurred between XAI quantitative metrics - Relevance Rank Accuracy and proposed Positive Attribution Ratio - across trained models. These results suggest that increased model complexity does not consistently lead to higher performance or the relevance of explanations of models’ decision-making processes.
